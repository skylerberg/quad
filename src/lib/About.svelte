  One morning, I woke from a dream of a tile game.
  I shared my dream with Jacob Tillson, and together we built Quad.
  Jacob's illustrations adorn each tile.

<p>
  Dozens of playtesters refined Quad, and special thanks are due to Joanna Tillson who named the game.

<p>
  Thanks for enjoying something we enjoyed creating for you!
